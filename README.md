# SuperCapi

A small game where the goal is to survive and collect all the coins.

This is a solo project completed in 2024.

## Execution

To launch the project, you must first install Unity Hub and Unity if you haven’t already. You can do this by following the instructions available on [this site](https://unity.com/download). Then, clone the repository, open Unity Hub, and add the Unity project by selecting the cloned folder.

Once the project is open, go to the "Project" section, navigate to the "Assets" folder, then "Scenes", and click on "Start Screen". To start the game, press the Play button located at the top of the interface, and the game will begin.

## About the Game

You play as a small capsule whose goal is to survive and collect as many coins as possible. The game has two levels, each ending with a white door that takes you to the next level or the end of the game.

To stay alive, you need to jump on platforms and avoid or eliminate the small pink squares—your enemies. These enemies can kill you on contact, but you can defeat them by jumping on top of them. Use the space bar to jump and the arrow keys on your keyboard to move.

The game includes relaxing background music and sound effects for certain actions.
